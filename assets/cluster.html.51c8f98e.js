By default, the instances discover each other using mDNS. This requires all of them live in the same subnet.

This could for example be the case if you have instances that are connected to the network better than others. To accomplish this you can configure custom weights that are then used during the leader election process. The <code>weight</code> option should ideally be configured on every instance of room-assistant that you run to achieve consistent behavior. The preferred leader instances need to have the largest weight numbers.</p><h2 id="troubleshooting" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Troubleshooting</h2><h3 id="some-nodes-not-appearing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#some-nodes-not-appearing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Some nodes not appearing</h3><p>If the auto discovery does not seem to pick up all (or any) nodes for your cluster you can approach the problem from two different directions:</p><ol><li>Make sure your router and network settings are compatible with mDNS/Bonjour. An easy way to test this is pinging your devices by their hostname, e.g. <code>ping raspberrypi.local</code>.</li><li>Disable <code>autoDiscovery</code> and provide the <code>peerAddresses</code> manually. Make sure to give your devices DHCP reservations or static IPs.</li></ol><p>Should the other nodes not appear in your cluster even after configuring it manually you should make sure that the devices can communication with each other via UDP on the port you configured, by default <code>6425</code>.</p><h3 id="mdns-errors" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#mdns-errors" aria-hidden="true">#</a> MDNS errors</h3><p>If you&#39;re seeing errors relating to MDNS discovery in your logs there is no need to worry - room-assistant will function fine even without it.

This ensures that only a cluster that contains the majority of instances can update the values. Set this number so that it represents the smallest instance count to constitute a majority in your setup. For example: if you have 3 instances of the software at home you would set <code>quorum</code> to 2, for 6 overall instances it should be 4.</p><h2 id="settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Settings</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Default</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>networkInterface</code></td><td>String</td><td></td><td>The specific network interface that room-assistant should advertise its presence on, e.g. <code>eth0</code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code>port</code></td><td>Number</td><td><code>6425</code></td><td>The UDP port that room-assistant should use for internal communication.</td></tr><tr><td><code>timeout</code></td><td>Number</td><td><code>60</code></td><td>Number of seconds that an instance can go without sending a heartbeat and not be dropped from the cluster.</td></tr><tr><td><code>weight</code></td><td>Number</td><td>Random</td><td>Value used to sort when electing a leading instance.
